## How to Use?
1. Clone this repo under your Q1 folder
2. cd into CSCI350_HW2_Q1_Checker

## How to contribute to this Repo?
1. create test input file in /Input folder: name as "[algorithm_name] + [description] + [.in]"
2. create expected output file in /Output folder: names as "[E_] + [algorithm_name] + [description] + [.out]"
  - 2.1 Be careful that the expected output file must be created and edited in unix systems, otherwise the different newline system will 
      cause test cases don't pass.
3. Make a pull request to this repo for review. If it's a good test, I will merge that into the master branch.
